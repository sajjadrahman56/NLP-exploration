# Basic of Pipeline 

A machine learning pipeline is a series of interconnected data processing and modelling steps designed to automate, standardize and streamline the process of building, training, evaluating and deploying machine learning models.

Traditionally, We(some learners) assume pipeline means starting from direct data collection to deployment. That is not wrong, but before collecting data we have to spend a good amount of time on `Requirement analysis` and `Feasibility Check`.


## Requirement analysis and Feasibility Check

  - Step-01: Domain Select ( Specific problem solution eg : health care )
  - Step -02 : Target Skills ( Pre model select , Data source and format )
  - Step-03: Time and Budget, also what is possible or not
