### ✅ Machine learning models can be grouped into **three main types**, based on what they're used for:

### 1. **Supervised Learning (Predictive Models)**

These models **learn from labeled data** — meaning each example in the data has a known output (target or label).
They try to **predict** the label for new data.

* 🔸 **Classification** (predicting categories):

  * Example: Will a customer buy? (Yes/No)
  * Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks

* 🔸 **Regression** (predicting numbers):

  * Example: What will the price of a house be?
  * Models: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor

**→ These are what we often call *predictive models*.**

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**

These models **don’t have labeled data** — they find patterns or structure in the data without knowing the "right" answers.

* 🔸 **Clustering**: Grouping similar items

  * Example: Customer segmentation
  * Models: K-Means, DBSCAN

* 🔸 **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifying data

  * Example: Visualizing high-dimensional data
  * Models: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP

### 3. **Semi-Supervised / Self-Supervised / Reinforcement Learning** (More advanced types)

* These are **less common** in basic ML workflows but important in advanced systems.
* Example: Chatbots learning from interactions (reinforcement), or models trained on data with few labels.

### ✅ So in short:

| Category              | Needs Labels?    | Goal                    | Example Models               |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Supervised**        | ✅ Yes            | Predict outcomes        | Logistic Regression, SVM     |
| **Unsupervised**      | ❌ No             | Find structure/patterns | K-Means, PCA                 |
| **Others (Advanced)** | Mixed or special | Depends                 | Reinforcement Learning, etc. |

---

So yes — **predictive models are part of supervised learning**, and **unsupervised models are another major group**, but there's a bit more than just those two.
