# What is Data?

- Everything we interact with can be called data, and around 90% of data is unstructured.  

### Common Misconception:  
There is a common misconception that since large language models are available, we no longer need data. However, for customization, we still need to collect data tailored to our specific needs.

### When We Collect Data:
- Data Sources: Data often comes in an unstructured form.  
- Time Required: Data collection can take anywhere from 1 to 6 months, whether done manually or automatically.  
- Data Validation: Data quality must be validated, which can vary between:
  - Healthy Data: Examples include "life or death" criticality.  
  - Low-Quality Data: Examples include scenarios like "prison or not."  

### Data Automation:
- Automation, such as data scraping, can help simplify data collection.  
- Challenge: The major challenge lies in validating the data, often requiring assistance or expertise to ensure its accuracy.  

### Why AI Products Are Expensive:
AI products are costly primarily because they rely heavily on high-quality data. A significant amount of time and resources is spent on data validation. The model itself is secondary to the value of validated, high-quality data.

- Key Insight:  
The higher the quality of the data, the more valuable the product becomes.
